## Problem Statement

When a job is posted online, it often receives thousands of applications within minutes. This makes it nearly impossible for hiring managers to review each application thoroughly and identify the best candidates. The traditional hiring process is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to missed opportunities and suboptimal hires.

## Our Solution

1. **Bulk Email Invitations**: Employers provide us with the email addresses of all applicants. We send out bulk emails inviting them to participate in the first round of screening.
2. **Initial Screening**: The first round consists of a basic aptitude test and general questions designed to weed out the least suitable candidates.
3. **AI-Powered Interviews**: In the next round, candidates who pass the initial screening will have a 1:1 interview with our AI. The AI conducts a live voice interview using the candidate's resume and the job description to assess their suitability.
